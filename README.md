ngReactor
=========

This is a simulation of a [Pressurized Water Reactor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressurized_water_reactor), inspired by the [Pax Reactor](http://henrik.zsolt-frei.net/Fun/Software/pax.html) project. The design target was the VVER-440 Soviet, as used by the [Paks nuclear power station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paks_Nuclear_Power_Plant) that is also simulated in Pax Reactor.

Play around and remember that in a simulation, losing is fun.
